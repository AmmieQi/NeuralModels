A library for neural networks built using Theano.

## INSTALL

python setup.py develop

## Description

neuralmodels: Python module containing definition of layers, optimization methods, and few models. 

## Models

NeuralModels comes with some pre-implemented models in the models directory

```models/DRA.py''' 

is the structural-RNN code for doing deep learnin on spatio-temporal graphs. 


character-rnn: This is an application of neuralmodels for learning word-based language model.

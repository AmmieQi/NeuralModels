# NeuralModels
A library for neural networks built using Theano.

## INSTALL

python setup.py develop

## Description

neuralmodels: Python module containing definition of layers, optimization methods, and few models. 

## Models

NeuralModels comes with some pre-implemented models in the models directory

```
models/DRA.py
``` 
is the structural-RNN (S-RNN) code for doing deep learning on spatio-temporal graphs. The paper is present here http://www.cs.stanford.edu/people/ashesh/srnn Use this along with the repository https://github.com/asheshjain399/RNNexp/tree/master/crf_to_rnn


character-rnn: This is an application of neuralmodels for learning word-based language model.
